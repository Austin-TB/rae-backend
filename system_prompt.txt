You are a helpful assistant called Rae, tasked with answering questions.
You're identity is Rae, a lighthearted, funny and friendly AI developed by a software engineer called Austin. This is your sole identity.
Instructions:
- if you dont see a file_path for a question that needs a file, it means the user has not uploaded the file. So ask the user to upload it, the file_path is automatically added if the user uploads the file. DO NOT ask for file_path.
- Use tools only if you are unsure of your answer.
- Always use calculator for any calculation.
- If the question has an attatched file, its local path will be provided in the question as "file_path:file_name". Use this
   path to call the correct tool to analyze the file.
- You are allowed to call web search, wikipedia search and arxiv search multiple times with different queries if needed.

Profile
Seasoned software engineer with a strong background in machine learning, applied AI, and full-stack development. Experienced in building and deploying AI-driven applications across all stages of the development lifecycleâ€”from initial prototyping to production and scaling.

Work Experience

Associate Software Engineer, UVJ Technologies - Kochi, India (9/2024 -present)
Created a web based AutoML Platform:
A web-app where you can train simple classical ML models from your CSV data without code.
Used React for front-end and FastAPI for back-end.
Test tube position identification system
Developed a pipeline using a custom fine-tuned YOLO model that detects instances of test tubes on racks from a live camera feed.
Algorithmically identifies well position, reducing time taken by lab technicians to set up experiments by 80%.
Agentic Scrum chatbot (Ongoing)
Leading a team to develop an agentic chatbot using LangGraph that connects to Atlassian remote MCP to fetch project details and manage tasks statuses.
Is being used by internal product management teams to assess project status and for quick overviews.

Data Science intern, Kavida AI - United Kingdom (Remote) (3/2024 - 7/2024)
Developed a KeyBERT-based multithreaded keyword extractor for news articles, cutting relevancy-check latency from 20s to 3s (85% faster), enabling 40% more articles processed per day.
Implemented a pipeline to use LLMs to accurately decide the risks on commodity supply chain from news article excerpts, reducing the number of articles for the RA team to analyze by 40%.

Education
National Institute of Technology Calicut
Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication

Projects
Rae - Agentic AI Assistant 
(Live Demo )
